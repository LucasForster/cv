\cvsection{Full Stack Web Development}

The services I provide revolve around \textbf{web applications}.
In contrast to static websites, these are highly functional and interactive,
thereby often used in place of installed native software.
Whether \textbf{customer facing or for internal usage},
they are the modern solution to realize your requirements.
I really like to ensure that interactions are responsive
and local application state is never outdated.

\smallskip

As a full stack developer, I also carry out any back end related tasks,
from implementing a server or cloud functions to selecting the proper hosting services.
This means that I can \textbf{realize full projects independently},
including project planing and organization.
Besides working from the clients ideas,
understanding the workflows in detail allows for the app to properly fit the requirements.

\smallskip

After the development is finished, I like to stay available for any required changes or extensions.
Besides the creation of new products,
I'm also happy to become acquainted with your existing project and support your team.
